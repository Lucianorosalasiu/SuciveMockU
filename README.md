# 🚀 SuperSuciveApi 🌐

Welcome to **SuperSuciveApi**, a mock application of a national payment system built with Jakarta, Maven, and deployed on WildFly. This project showcases a SOAP web service implementation that allows users to submit payment details and receive a response indicating the success or failure of the payment processing.

## 🌟 Features

- **SOAP Web Service**: Implementation of a SOAP web service for submitting payments.
- **Jakarta EE**: Utilizes Jakarta EE for building robust and scalable enterprise applications.
- **WildFly**: Deployed on WildFly application server for high performance and reliability.
- **Maven**: Managed with Maven for easy project build and dependency management.
- **JUnit**: Unit tests implemented using JUnit 5.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Jakarta EE**: For building the enterprise application.
- **SOAP**: For the web service communication.
- **WildFly**: As the application server.
- **Maven**: For project build and dependency management.
- **JUnit**: For testing the application.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **JDK 11**: Ensure you have JDK 11 installed.
- **Maven**: Ensure you have Maven installed.
- **WildFly**: Ensure you have WildFly application server installed and running.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/SuperSuciveApi.git
   cd SuperSuciveApi
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   ```sh
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Deploy the application on WildFly**:

   ```sh
   mvn wildfly:deploy
   ```

## 🌐 SOAP Web Service

### WSDL

The WSDL for the `SubmitPayment` service is available at:
```
http://localhost:8080/SuciveMockU-1.0-SNAPSHOT/SuciveImp?wsdl
```

### Example SOAP Request

Here is an example of a SOAP request to submit a payment:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:ns="http://unknown.namespace/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <ns:SubmitPayment>
         <arg0>ABC123</arg0>
         <arg1>123.45</arg1>
      </ns:SubmitPayment>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

### Example SOAP Response

If the service processes the payment successfully, the response will be:

```xml
<soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/">
   <soapenv:Header/>
   <soapenv:Body>
      <ns:SubmitPaymentResponse xmlns:ns="http://unknown.namespace/">
         <ns:return>Payment processed successfully.</ns:return>
      </ns:SubmitPaymentResponse>
   </soapenv:Body>
</soapenv:Envelope>
```

## 🧪 Running Tests

To run the unit tests, use the following command:

```sh
mvn test
```

## 🎉 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a basic implementation of a SOAP web service using Jakarta EE, Maven, and WildFly. Feel free to explore and contribute to enhance the functionality!
